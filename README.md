This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Ecommerce Cosmetics App
## Hosting URL: https://cosmetics-1e95b.web.app
## Development
This app was developed by a team of two members: Olabisi Odusanya and Veronika Maisuradze. The aim is to allow users to shop (register, login, add products to shopping cart, search and filter products, etc.) and admin - to manage products, orders and categories.
## Software
The application utilizes the MERN stack: React on the frontend; and Node.js, Express and Mongoose on the backend. On reaching the URL, the user has the option to either log in (if previously registered) or register, if they're totally new to the app. Once registered, this information will be stored in the database and the user will be taken to the home page. Once there, the user can start shopping, search products by category or product name, filter by price, view producs in detail, add to cart, remove from cart, see related products, see the final price and proceed with payment.
## Connection
The backend was built with the Nodejs which was connected to the MongoDB to store the user details, products' information and categories, while the frontend (user interface) was built using the react js. Both applications were connected and are linked to each other. Backend is deployed on heroku, and frontend - on firebase. The frontend design was made using the react bootstrap, (app.js) uses the hooks implementation of the react functional component as opposed to the 'state' in class component.
## Installation and Setup Instructions
Clone down this repository. You will need node (to run the backend) and npm installed globally on your machine.
Installation: npm install. To run test suite: npm test. To start server: npm start. To view it in the browser: localhost:3000.
## Reflection
This was an 8 week long project built during the last module at Fullstack Web Development programme at Business College Helsinki. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing ourselves with documentation for new features.
